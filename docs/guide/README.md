## Getting started

**Install**

Before install, make sure your project use `vue-router`
in [`history` mode](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html).

This is needed to make SSR work correctly.

```bash
vue add @uvue/ssr
```

This plugins add commands to run or build your application in SSR mode:

**Start a development server with HMR**

```bash
npm run ssr:serve
```

**Build for production**

```bash
npm run ssr:build
```

**Start in production mode** (need a `npm run ssr:build` before)

```bash
npm run ssr:start
```

**Generate a static website**

```bash
npm run ssr:static
```

**Try to fix code to be SSR compatible**

```bash
npm run ssr:fix
```

:::tip
The `serve` and `build` commands are still available to run your application in SPA mode
